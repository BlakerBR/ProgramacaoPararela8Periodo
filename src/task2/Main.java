// Consider two numbers a e b (b≠ 0) read by the keyboard and a time ti, 
// randomly generated from 1 to 20, where ∈{Sum,Sub,Mul,Div}. Develop an 
// algorithm which creates four threads, where each one will calculate one of 
// four basic options about a and b: Sum, Subtraction, Multiplication e Division.
// Besides every operation, each thread should execute other two basic operations,
// printing the time ti on the screen (in seconds) where it will "sleep"
// and print it on the screen, after the passing of the ti seconds, which it is then going to end.
