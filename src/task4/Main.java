//TASK:
//Develop an algorithm, using the strategies which were previously implemented (Threads and mechanisms of concurrence
//control )in order to solve the lower linear triangular system Lx = b where Lx = b is a lower triangular matrix. The 
//Its algorithm needs to use two threads: one to calculate the value of (that is to solve the system) and the other to	
//calculate the summation.
